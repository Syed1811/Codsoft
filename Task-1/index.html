        </h4>

        <h4 class="aboutinfo">
          &#9755; Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the
          Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research
          and Development Organisation (DRDO).
        </h4>

        <h4 class="aboutinfo">
          &#9755; In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation,
          where he was project director of the SIV-III, the first satellite
          launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India.
        </h4>

        <h4 class="aboutinfo">
          &#9755; Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that
          produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the
          nickname "Missile Man."
        </h4>

        <h4 class="aboutinfo">
          &#9755; Among those successes was Agni, India's first
          intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of
          the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.
        </h4>

        <h4 class="aboutinfo">
          &#9755; His prominent role in the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests
          solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a
          national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the
          international community.
        </h4>

        <h4 class="aboutinfo">
          &#9755; In 1908 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology
          Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India
          from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan
          called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural
          productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth,
          and widening access to health care and education.
        </h4>

          &#9755; In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honor, the

          National Space Society to recognize excellence in the management and
          leadership of a space-related project.
        </h4>

        <h4 class="aboutinfo">
          &#9755; While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of
          Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac
          arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.
